## [Arbitrage Opportunity, Impossible Frontier, and Logical Circularity in CAPM Equilibrium](CAPM.md)

If the expected return of a stock is determined by its beta, we will face the chicken-and-egg problem: a stock’s return is determined from its beta, but beta itself depends on the return directly. On the other hand, to calculate the beta, we need to know the market return first, and to calculate the market return, we need to know the returns of each stock. Johnstone (2017, p.503) refers to this situation as “the logical circularity built into the CAPM equilibrium mechanism”. Does this logical circularity really exist?


## [Perfect Market, Arbitrage, and Value Creation in the MM Proposition](MM.md)

To explain the evolution of the understanding of arbitrage from a deterministic world into an uncertain world, we restate and comment on the proofs of the MM Proposition in current perspectives. With the no-arbitrage principle in mind, we clearly read <span style="color:red">*the circular justification in the MM Proposition and the misleading concept of cost of equity*</span>.
